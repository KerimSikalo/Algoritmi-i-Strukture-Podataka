# Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to my repository for **Algorithms and Data Structures**! This repository contains homeworks and preparatory exercises I completed as part of the course on this subject. It showcases various algorithms and data structures and code implementations of Data Structures.

## Contents

- **Homeworks**: A series of assignments covering fundamental topics like sorting algorithms, searching techniques, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.
- **Preparatoru Exercises**: Additional exercises to prepare for the course exams, focusing on key algorithmic concepts and problem-solving techniques.
  
## Topics Covered

- **Searching Algorithms** (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- **Recursion and Divide-and-Conquer**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Algorithms** (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
- **Data Structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Maps, Heaps)
- **Greedy Algorithms**
